\section[Background]{About the random forest models and simulations}

\begin{frame}{Data used}

{\footnotesize

\noindent Goal: Predict the number of degree days since death based on
the numbers and types of microbial communities present on the cadavers.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent We considered different taxa levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Family-level taxa alone
\item Order-level taxa alone
\item Phylum-level taxa alone
\item All the above combined
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent Time scale:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tried models utilizing all 61 days of observations in the data set
\item Tried models utilizing the first 15 days of observations. (After
  15 days, the observations are approx.~weekly, rather than every 2
  days.)
\end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{For a given taxa level (families, orders, or phyla)}

  {\scriptsize

  \noindent For each cadaver and each day, we have counts of the taxa
  detected on swabs from the cadaver.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Completely excluded counts of ``unclassified'' taxa.
   \item For all classified taxa, converted the counts to percentages (count of each taxa on each cadaver and each day, divided by total counts for that cadaver on that day)
    \item Some taxa are ``rare''; that is, the number of associated
      counts are very small.  Considered ``rare'' if the percentage
      represented by that taxa for any cadaver on any day never
      amounted to 1\% of the daily count.
      \item The percentages associated with ``rare'' taxa were not
        included in the random forest models.
    \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  
  \noindent The highest percentages of rare taxa were:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item families: 7.20\% on day 47 for subject A6 (deg. day 1326)
  \item orders: 3.68\% on day 0 for subject A1
  \item phylum: 0.95\% on day 0 for subject A1
      \end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Distribution of the degree days}

  {\scriptsize
  
    \noindent Since the degree days (the responses) are so
    right-skewed, I fit all the random forest models in each of two ways:\\
    - using the actual degree days as the response variable\\
    - using the square root of the degree days as the response variable

    
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{degdays_all_time_steps_hist}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{sqrt_degdays_all_time_steps_hist}
\end{figure}
  }
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Looking at just the first 2 weeks}

  {\scriptsize
    \noindent I also fit random forest models separately for:\\
    - the whole range of time steps (61 days)\\
    - just the first 15 days

    \vspace{0.05in}
    
    \noindent After the first 15 days, the observations occur much
    less frequently, on the order of about once a week, so there is a
    natural breaking point in the data here.
    
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{degdays_first_two_weeks_hist}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{sqrt_degdays_first_two_weeks_hist}
\end{figure}
  }
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Fitting the random forest models}

  {\footnotesize

    \begin{itemize}
  \item For each scenario, we have to determine the number of variables to consider for each split of the random forest decision tree.
  \item Considering only a subset of available variables at each split allows the random forest technique to work well when variables are correlated.
  \item To determine the number that works best in each scenario, we use a series of cross-validation runs, leaving out a 10\% subset of our data each time and using the remaining data to fit the model and make predictions.
    \item Each model is then fit using the number of splits that
      worked best in cross-validation runs.
      \item This was done for 16 different models.
    \end{itemize}
