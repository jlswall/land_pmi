\section[Background]{About the random forest models and simulations}

\begin{frame}{Data used}

{\footnotesize

\noindent Goal: Predict the number of degree days since death based on
the numbers and types of microbial communities present on the cadavers.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent We considered different taxa levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Family-level taxa alone
\item Order-level taxa alone
\item Phylum-level taxa alone
\item Currently, I'm completing runs using all the above combined
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent Time scale:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tried models utilizing all 61 days of observations in the data set
\item Tried models utilizing the first 15 days of observations. (After
  15 days, the observations are approx.~weekly, rather than every 2
  days.)
\end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{For a given taxa level (families, orders, or phyla)}

  {\scriptsize

  \noindent For each cadaver and each day, we have counts of the taxa
  detected on swabs from the cadaver.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Completely excluded counts of ``unclassified'' taxa.
   \item For all classified taxa, converted the counts to percentages (count of each taxa on each cadaver and each day, divided by total counts for that cadaver on that day)
    \item Some taxa are ``rare''; that is, the number of associated
      counts are very small.  Considered ``rare'' if the percentage
      represented by that taxa for any cadaver on any day never
      amounted to 1\% of the daily count.
      \item The percentages associated with ``rare'' taxa were not
        included in the random forest models.
    \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  
  \noindent The highest percentages of rare taxa were:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item families: 7.20\% on day 47 for subject A6 (deg. day 1326)
  \item orders: 3.68\% on day 0 for subject A1
  \item phylum: 0.95\% on day 0 for subject A1
      \end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Distribution of the degree days}

  {\scriptsize
  
    \noindent Since the degree days (the responses) are so
    right-skewed, I fit all the random forest models in each of two ways:\\
    - using the actual degree days as the response variable\\
    - using the square root of the degree days as the response variable

    
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{degdays_all_time_steps_hist}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{sqrt_degdays_all_time_steps_hist}
\end{figure}
  }
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Looking at just the first 2 weeks}

  {\scriptsize
    \noindent I also fit random forest models separately for:\\
    - the whole range of time steps (61 days)\\
    - just the first 15 days

    \vspace{0.05in}
    
    \noindent After the first 15 days, the observations occur much
    less frequently, on the order of about once a week, so there is a
    rather natural breaking point in the data here.
    
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{degdays_first_two_weeks_hist}
  \includegraphics[width=2.1in]{sqrt_degdays_first_two_weeks_hist}
\end{figure}
  }
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Fitting the random forest models}

  {\footnotesize

    \begin{itemize}
  \item For each different scenario, we have to determine the number of variables to consider for each split of the random forest decision tree.
  \item Considering only a subset of available variables at each split allows the random forest technique to work well when variables are correlated.
  \item To determine the number that works best in each scenario, we use a series of cross-validation runs, leaving out a subset of our data each time and using the remaining data to fit the model and make predictions.
    \item Each model is then fit using the number of splits that
      worked best in cross-validation runs.
      \item This was done for 12 different models.  (Four more models,
        using combined taxa, are in process.)

\begin{frame}{``Common'' phylum taxa}

\begin{itemize}
\item Actinobacteria
\item Bacteroidetes
\item Firmicutes
\item Proteobacteria
\item All others grouped together as ``rare''
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent These phyla are consistent with Pechal et al (2013).  See
their Figure 1a.

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{``Common'' order taxa}

\noindent For order taxa, it's not clear which taxa should be
considered ``rare''.  Depending on whether you look at relative
abundance overall, by day, or by day-subject, you'll get different
numbers of ``common'' (not rare) taxa.
  
\begin{itemize}
\item There are only 6 taxa which have more than 3\% of overall
  relative abundance.  This seems too few and would leave out taxa
  which are prevalent for only a short time.
\item There are 13 taxa which have more than 3\% relative abundance on
  at least one day for at least one cadaver.  This list may be too
  broad, including taxa that are prevalent on just 1-2 cadavers for a
  short period of time.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent I've taken the middle path, including taxa with have 3\%
relative abundance (over all cadavers) for at least one day.  This
leaves 11 taxa.

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{``Common'' family taxa}

\noindent For family taxa, the situation is similar to that for the order taxa.
  
\begin{itemize}
\item There are only 8 taxa which have more than 3\% of overall
  relative abundance.  This seems too few and would leave out taxa
  which are prevalent for only a short time.
\item There are 32 taxa which have more than 3\% relative abundance on
  at least one day for at least one cadaver.  This list may be too
  broad, including taxa that are prevalent on just 1-2 cadavers for a
  short period of time.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent Again, I've taken the middle path, including taxa which have
3\% relative abundance (over all cadavers) for at least one day.  This
leaves 19 taxa, which is similar to the number of taxa represented in
Figure 1b of Pechal et al (2013).

\section{Analysis ideas}


\begin{frame}{Issues/discussion}
  
\begin{itemize}
\item The explanatory variables are compositional fractions (for each day and each cadaver).
\item Multicollinearity (strong dependencies among the explanatory variables) makes it difficult to use typical modeling techniques.
\item Metcalf et al used random forests to try to predict the PMI; this strategy can be efficient with multicollinearity.  That is the approach I've pursued in the next few slides.
  \item You had mentioned DFA (discriminant function analysis) in an earlier email.  That would involve treating the response variable not as a number of days (or degree days), but as a classification variable.  That changes how we would interpret the model.  I did do some runs with random forest models for classification (which would be similar), and we can talk more about those if you like.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Random forests}

\begin{itemize}
\item I used days (PMI) as the
  response variable, rather than degree days.  However, these are
  strongly correlated in our example, so I expect that the results
  would be similar.
  \item Random forest models are a bit hard to interpret; the
    estimates are made based on an ensemble of decision trees.  This
    means that you can't write down the fitted model as an equation
    (as you would for, say, a linear regression model).  However, it
    is straightforward to use a fitted model to make predictions for a
    new set of data.
\item Like Metcalf et al, I used cross-validation to estimate the
  best parameters for the random forest model.  These parameters are
  the number of variables considered at each split of the tree and the
  number of trees making up your ensemble.
\end{itemize}

The fitted model was able to explain about 67.5\% of the variability, with a root MSE of about 11.3 days.  From cross-validation, the most reasonable models considered 6-8 splits and used at least 3000 ensemble trees.}

  days.  From cross-validation, the most reasonable models considered
  4 splits and used about 3000 ensemble trees.}

\begin{frame}{More discussion}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The ``more specific'' the taxa-level, the smaller our
    mean-square error.  This is interesting, because as we get more
    specific, we have more unclassified material.  The unclassified
    material is excluded from the analysis.  So, even with the loss of
    that data, our predictions are still better with the family-level taxa.
  \item Random forest models are not easy to explain, as they do not produce a fitted regression line, etc.  However, it should be straightforward to make predictions when given a new dataset.
    \item It would be great to get some additional data to use to test
      these models.
  \item For now, I've put the PCA/GAM model idea on the back shelf, due
  to the difficulties in interpreting the effect of any one taxa when
  we use principal components.
