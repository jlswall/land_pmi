\noindent Dear Dr.~Singh:

\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent I am pleased to be listed as a statistical consultant on
your research proposal, entitled ``Impact of carrion decomposition on
soil microbial structure''.  This project will likely require the
application of innovative statistical methods, such as those we have
developed and discussed during our recent research efforts.  If the
proposal receives funding, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed
in the project description.

\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent I anticipate a successful and rewarding research project.
If you should need any additional information, please feel free to
contact me at jswall@vcu.edu.

\noindent Sincerely,
