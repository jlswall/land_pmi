% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

  \noindent Data was read from Excel file:\\
  \texttt{Shane\_all\_skin\_samples\_taxo\_bs\_05\_05\_2017.xlsx}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Phylum data from \texttt{Phylum\_all} worksheet
    \item Family data from \texttt{family\_all\_bsedit} worksheet
    \item On both worksheets, there is an anomaly in the averages
      reported at day 1 (ADD 27).  The values in this column are sums
      of the counts from the 6 cadavers.  This contrasts with the
      other T\#\_\#\# columns, which contain average counts.
    \item There were 34 classified phylum taxa, 231(?) family taxa?
    \item Six pigs observed on each of 16 days, except:\\
      - Subject 1 not observed on days 7 and 9\\
      - Subject 4 not observed on day 7
