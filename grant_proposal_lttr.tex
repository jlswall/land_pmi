\noindent I am pleased to be listed as a statistical consultant on
your research proposal, entitled ``Novel quantitative approaches for
postmortem interval (PMI) estimation of human cadavers''.  This
project will likely require the application of innovative statistical
methods, as we have discussed during our recent research collaboration.
If the proposal receives funding, I look forward to providing the
necessary statistical expertise and support to ensure a successful
completion.

If you should need any additional information regarding the proposal,
please feel free to contact me at jswall@vcu.edu.
